This is a mock inbox built with React and Redux (in the redux branch). 
Messages can be selected individually or all at once, they can be marked read or unread, deleted, and starred, and tags can be added and removed to them. Changes are persisted in a database. 
Compose message function allows 'sending' a message to the inbox.
